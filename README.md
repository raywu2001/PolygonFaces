# PolygonFaces
Algorithms to compute interior faces, neighboring faces of a face, whether a point is located inside or outside of a face, layers of neighbor faces of a face given a set of vertices connected by edges in the plane. 

The code is implemented in JavaScript and an HTML page is used to present the output of the algorithms. The code does not use any libraries, only browser APIâ€™s.

Download PolygonFaces.html and PolygonFaces.js and copy them to any folder on your local computer. Then you can launch the HTML page PolygonFaces.html to verify the result. You can edit PolygonFaces.html to update the input testing data.
